## [LaPrimaire.org](https://laprimaire.org) — LaPrimaire.org Android App

[LaPrimaire.org](https://laprimaire.org) aims at crowdsourcing the next french President through the first open democratic primary:

* **Democratic** because anybody can be a candidate
* **Open** because the primary in itself does not defend any ideology and is open to all ideas that comply to the law

Obviously, due to the scale of the primary, it can only happen online and this is why we developed a Telegram bot to guide participating citizens through the primary. As we created a Telegram bot, we could just have asked participating citizens to download, install Telegram and then contact our bot but, given that a lot of citizens are not computer savvy at all (to say the least) we though it might be a good idea not to confuse them by having to explain to them what Telegram is.

This is why we decided to make a mini-fork of [Telegram Messenger for Android App](https://github.com/DrKLO/Telegram). What's a mini-fork ? It is a fork that only bring cosmetic changes and will never diverge a lot from the upstream Telegram Android App. Our goal was not to add or remove features from Telegram Android App but to provide citizens with a more natural and straightforward on-boarding flow to the Telegram bot.

[Telegram Messenger for Android](http://telegram.org) is a messaging app with a focus on speed and security. It’s superfast, simple and free. This repo contains the official source code for [LaPrimaire.org App for Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.telegraph.messenger).
